This repository shows how using spatially heterogeneous causal estimates of yield gains to an agricultural technology, 
one can use a spatially differentiated (e.g., district level) economic surplus approach (Alston et al 1995) which has 
conventionally been conducted at country level. The workflow can be found here:  <a href="https://maxwellmkondiwa.github.io/spatial-economic-surplus/" target="_blank"> Spatial Economic Surplus Approach</a>.

The data and code for generating the causal ML yield gains to herbicides (herbicides versus no weeding excluding manual weeding) are in the folder: Causal_ML_estimation.
